Welcome to the code pairing interview.
This repo contains a set of functions to create a calculator as well as being set up to allow for Cucumber tests.

The ask of you is to write tests to cover the functionality of the calculator and fix any bugs they may show.

The calculator is split into 4 parts.

Addition
Sum of number 1 and number 2

Subtraction
Number 1 minus number 2

Division
Number 1 divided by number 2, this function cannot use the divide symbol "/".
A value of 0 should return 0.

Multiplication
Number 1 multiplied by number 2.

The number should remain as whole integers but may go below 0 where appropriate.
